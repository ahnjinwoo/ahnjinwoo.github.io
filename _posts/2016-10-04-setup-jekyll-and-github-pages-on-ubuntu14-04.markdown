## EasyBook Advanced Functions ##



### Add a link ###

EasyBook does not make the footer heavy; the link to theme could be on `about.md`:

> This website is using [laobubu](http://laobubu.net)'s theme: [EasyBook](https://github.com/laobubu/jekyll-theme-EasyBook)

### Donate (PayPal or 支付宝) ###

That's the best :smile: 

Please visit [http://laobubu.net/donate.html](http://laobubu.net/donate.html)

### Star and Fork on GitHub (free) ###

Not going to donate? That's okay. You can also send out your precious star [on GitHub][github-easybook].
